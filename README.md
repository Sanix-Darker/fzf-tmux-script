# fzf-tmux-script

These are my fzf-tmux scripts, just for fun!

## Requirements

1. [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
2. [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

## Customization

Read the Fucking source code which only almost a few lines, and write down your loved script.

You will fall in love with the expandability of `fzf` and `tmux`.

> The expandability makes `shell script` bloated that is not cost-effective.
